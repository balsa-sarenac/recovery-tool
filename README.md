# Recovery tool
After transitioning from Windows to Linux I made this simple python program that copies all files from given directory to another given directory and removes timestamp suffixes.
To call the program pass 2 arguments, first one is path to Users folder in your Windows file backup, second one is path where to copy all the files.
